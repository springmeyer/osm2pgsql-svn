* there is still room for code cleanups

** the postgres specific files also contain some general functions
  that could/should be moved out to separate files so that they
  may be shared by other middle and output backends in the future

* in the long run it may make sense to go for C++ all the way

** the C++ interface to Google ProtoBuffers is much more mature than
   its C counterpart

** inheriting input, middle, and output plugin implementations from
   abstract C++ base clases would provide a cleaner and more readable
   interface than the current C99 struct based implementation IMHO
