== 2010-11-06 Version 0.70.5 ==

* missing libraries are now already detected by 'configure'
  instead of only breaking the build at compile time later

* the existing 'libxml2' and experimental 'primitive' XML
  readers and a new 'pbf' reader for the Protobuf based
  format are now all available in the main binary, 
  selectable using the new -r|--input-reader command line
  option
